        <h3 style="color:red;">Brief Education Overview</h3> 
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Aamnah Malik. I am a sophomore at Quinnipiac University, and my major is 
            Computer Science. I started as a Biochemistry major, with the intention to go into the 
            medical field, but have found a greater interest in Computer Science in the last year.

        <h3 style="color:red;">My Interest in Computer Science</h3> 
        <p>
            The reason I have developed an interest in CS is the very diverse applications of the 
            industry, as well as the constant innovative developments. For example, AI has become 
            increasingly popular lately - this is one of the most intriguing branches of CS for me, 
            as I plan to complete a research project involving AI and Cybersecurity this summer.

        <h3 style="color:red;">Prior Knowledge</h3> 
        <p>
            Before switching my major, my CS exposure and experience were relatively limited. I had 
            used some programming applications when I was younger, like Swift Playgrounds, but I 
            didn't have much overall coding knowledge. Throughout the last 2 semesters, I have

        <h3 style="color:red;">General Information</h3> 
        <p>
            I have 2 siblings - an older brother and a younger brother. My older brother studied
            Accounting, and my younger brother will start college in the fall studying Data Science. 
            I love spending time outside and with my friends, and one of my favorite things to do is 
            go to the beach.
